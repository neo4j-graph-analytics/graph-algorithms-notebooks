== Run the notebooks locally

If we want to run the notebooks locally we need to setup Python and Neo4j environments.

=== Python

I use https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/[virtualenv^] but that's just one option.
We can run the following set of commands to create a Python environment with the libraries installed:

```
virtualenv a
. a/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

=== Neo4j

We'll also need to have a Neo4j server, with the Graph Algorithms library installed, running locally.
The easiest way to do this is to download the Neo4j Desktop from http://neo4j.com/download[neo4j.com/download^].

Once we've done that we can create a project and then install Graph Algorithms from the Plugins section.

=== Launching Jupyter

We're now ready to launch the Jupyter server.

The notebooks assume that there's a Neo4j server running at `localhost:7687` with username `neo4j` and password `neo`.
You can override these values with environment variables.

```
NEO4J_HOST="bolt://localhost:7687" NEO4J_USER="neo4j" NEO4J_PASSWORD="neo" jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8888/notebooks - the notebooks will be waiting!
